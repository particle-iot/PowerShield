_The Power Shield library provides functions to use the on-board MAX17043 fuel guage via I2C_

## Examples

1. **Read voltage over serial:** In this example the Particle device sends the voltage and SoC readings over serial every 1 second
2. **Publish voltage readings:** In this example the Particle device publishes the voltage and SoC readings every 10 minutes and stays in deep sleep mode for the rest of the time
